**TELEGRAM MESSAGE ARCHIVER**

The **Telegram Message Archiver** is a Python script designed to archive messages received or sent by the Telegram Alerts script. It listens for messages from the Telegram Alerts script and stores them locally for future reference or analysis. This tool is useful for maintaining a record of Telegram messages related to alerts or notifications generated by other scripts or systems.

**FEATURES**

- Automatically archives messages from the Telegram Alerts script.
- Stores message details locally in a text file for easy retrieval.
- Can be run continuously as a background service or scheduled task.

**USAGE**

1. **Install Dependencies**: Ensure you have Python installed on your system. Additionally, make sure to install any required Python packages by running:
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

2. **Configure Telegram Alerts**: Ensure that your Telegram Alerts script is configured to forward messages to the archiver. You may need to modify the Telegram Alerts script to include functionality for message forwarding.

3. **Run the Archiver**: Execute the `telegram_message_archiver.py` script to start archiving messages. You can run the script using the following command:
    ```
    python telegram_message_archiver.py
